# Tiny Toes - A PreNatal Healthcare App
Tiny Toes is an interactive mobile application to improve the health and well being of women and infants in both their Pre and Postnatal stages. It includes educational and clinical care required to ensure maternal and neonatal care.</Br>
Most women in India today don't get the required education and care about a healthy pregnancy. Particularly in rural parts women do not visit the doctor for regular checkups and they do not keep a check on their health as well as the baby's health.</Br>
So we, under the guidance of doctors of PGI Chandigarh, collaborated to develop a solution to this problem in the form of a mobile application called Tiny Toes which helps pregnant women in pre and postnatal care.</Br>
